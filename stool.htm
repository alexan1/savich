<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">By the time I came along into the world, 
my father had already graduated from a course at the local university and was 
working as an inspector in the </span><span lang="RU">ÎÁÕÑÑ</span><span lang="EN-US">. 
&nbsp;To this day I don’t have a clue what department it stands for. Something to do 
with speculators and embezzlers of government property.&nbsp; I don’t know whether my 
father was pleased about my birth, but it is a known fact that he didn’t show up 
for my discharge from the hospital.&nbsp; Three decades later, I didn’t turn up at 
the hospital to pick my daughter up either.&nbsp; Apparently it runs in the family.&nbsp; 
But that doesn’t mean I wasn’t happy she was born.&nbsp; On the contrary, I was 
thrilled. I adore my daughter. God bless her!</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Enough already!&nbsp; This isn’t a story 
about love, it’s about music.&nbsp; More precisely it deals with a guitar, a stool 
and perhaps life while we’re at it.&nbsp; I leave it up to reader.&nbsp; I’ve got to get 
going with the tale.&nbsp; So yeah, anyway, my father.&nbsp; He was always busy in the 
service: busy investigating, catching gangsters, putting them behind bars, 
conducting raids, pickets, ambushes – all called Operativka, operational work.&nbsp; 
He was at it morning to night, sometimes all night.&nbsp; I always thought of my 
father as a top secret spy, a cross between Richard Zorge and Nikolai 
Kuznetsov.&nbsp; Our paths seldom came together.&nbsp; At times I felt I loved my father, 
and sometimes I’m afraid, though it’s terrible to say, I hated him.&nbsp; Our 
relationship was like a thermometer in March. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">“Stop biting your nails.&nbsp; Stop picking 
your nose. Concentrate. Shut up – I’ll tell you when to talk!” That was the 
voice of the officer, heavy as lead.&nbsp; The mercury fell down way below zero.
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">“Chasing bitches, again,” my mother 
cried, shaking the dry grass and pine needles from his coat.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">“What d’you mean? I spent the night in 
an ambush,” came the quiet, tired voice of my father.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The word ambush, full of danger and 
terror, spoken in such a quiet tired voice sounded purely heroic.&nbsp; I vividly 
imagined my father lying in a wet ravine waiting for bitches.&nbsp; Bitches – some 
gloomy unshaven guy – wandering through the forest amid fallen trees in the 
night, swearing obscenely and plotting something wicked and vile, and then my 
father springing out, shouting,” Gotcha, you bitch you!” and landing on him, 
pinning him down, and taking him in under arrest to headquarters.&nbsp; In such 
moments the mercury shot up.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Never did the thermometer go up so high 
as the time he got into his car accident.&nbsp; Rumors were flying that on that day 
my father was chasing bitches, but I still believed the ambush version.&nbsp; The 
doctor gave him only twenty-four hours.&nbsp; But he survived and soon I was hearing 
once more, “Stop biting your nails.&nbsp; Stop picking your nose.” The temperature 
went down to its lowest, and with it my regret the doctor was wrong, when I 
became a beatnik.&nbsp; I even recall the words of my father regarding my new life.&nbsp; 
“It’d be better if you became a thief.” What? Why? “Because there’s nothing 
about a hippie that’s human.”&nbsp; Come on. “Yeah, I mean it. &nbsp;A guy should be 
handsome.&nbsp; But what’s a hippie?&nbsp; Nothing but hair down to his knees, 
boogie-woogie and epileptic fits.”&nbsp; What’s it got to do with epilepsy? I asked.&nbsp; 
“Hey, I’ve seen the way you guys dance.” OK, I said, maybe there’s nothing 
beautiful about hippies.&nbsp; But they sure have a hot life! I exclaimed, rather 
pathetically, I know.&nbsp; “A man needs to live his life like Pavel Korchagin if he 
doesn’t want to end up sick and wasted.”&nbsp; Korchagin, come off it – he’s a total 
has-been! Richie Blackmore’s the guy!&nbsp; “Just wait a couple of decades and&nbsp; your 
children will be calling Blekmordov the has-been.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">My father happened to be right about 
that one.&nbsp; For my daughter, the new Pavel Korchagin is Nick Carter of the 
Backstreet Boys. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">I reminded my father of Eazy Dey Xer 
Nait, mangling the title of the Beatles’ song.&nbsp; He blew up.&nbsp; The thing is, hard, 
“xer” happens to mean <i>dick</i> in Russian.&nbsp; And like all second generation 
men who have brains, my father despised crude jargon.&nbsp; “Wake up before it’s too 
late, boy. Or you’re going to find yourself behind bars.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">But I wasn’t listening.&nbsp; For our 
generation obeying one’s elders was as old-fashioned as reading Ostrovsky, and I 
went on listening to Deep Purple and spending all my free time with my guitar, 
doing my best to sound like Richie Blackmore.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">“What the fuck, man! Do Blackmore, on 
that piece of shit of yours?” cried Obodovsky, the top guitarist of our little 
town.&nbsp; I was speechless. “You wanna play Blackmore, you gotta have a 
StratakasterAnd old Obodovski pulled out of his crimson case a Fender 
Stratakaster.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Timidly I asked, “Can it be?”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">“Un momento,” he said and plugged the 
guitar into the amp.&nbsp; My palms were sweating, my fingers shaking, my forehead 
was burning. I waited to come down a bit, touched the neck of the guitar and 
started playing Highway Star. I’ll be damned if it didn’t sound better than the 
original.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">I put down the guitar.&nbsp; Obodovsky ‘s 
eyes were popping out.&nbsp; “Holy shit, man!”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">“How much is this piece of equipment?” I 
asked, evading Obodovsky’s regard.&nbsp; He named the amount: alas, it was the cost 
of a brand-new Lada. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">So that’s when I started building my own 
guitar.&nbsp; I begged for some materials, stole others, bought some stuff, bartered 
for still others.&nbsp; I even hung out around the cars as they were being unloaded 
at the local glue factory.&nbsp; It was known as Syarilvka, Shit-shack, in the town, 
for it was a pile of slimey bones crawling with greasy larvae and a whole armada 
of nasty rats.&nbsp; But I got the guitar going. I built the shell out of a huge 
chunk of cork tree, which I traded for a bottle of Stolichnaya at the village 
dump. (The vodka I’d swiped from the family liquor cabinet.)&nbsp; I traded in a 
porcelain statuette and got some branded pick-ups.&nbsp; The figurine with my name 
engraved on it would come back to haunt me as I was interrogated by the 
porcelain maker Alexi Kuz’kin.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">“Show me your diary,” my father ordered 
.&nbsp; For once he’d returned early from work.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">“Whatever for?”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">“I wanna know how you’re doing in 
physics,” he said.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp; “I’m doing OK in physics,” I replied.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">“Why physics?” my mother wanted to 
know.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">“Because he builds his guitars out of 
broken public phone boxes.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">“Damn,” I said. “Alexi told me I could 
get branded&nbsp; pick-ups.”&nbsp; I was cursing Alexi. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">“You bad bad boy!” my mother yelled 
out.&nbsp; “How <i>could</i> you?”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">I couldn’t make out what upset her more, 
the theft of our family statuette, the vodka or the three destroyed public 
telephones. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">“All right,” my father said.&nbsp; “I want 
all this Beatlemania out of the house this minute!”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">“I have legitimate right to house and 
property!” I objected.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">“OK, I lay claim to my right as owner of 
this house,” he retorted, closing in on my musical possessions. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">“You touch my stuff and I’ll kill you,” 
I swore, my blood seething.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Damn you, Makhno! Call the Japanese 
police! You’ve had it, boy!&nbsp; We Soviets brought Hitler to his knees, but for a 
beatnik like you a couple of smacks’ll do the job!” my father cried, trampling 
my <i>Dieperpoltsev</i> cassette underfoot. The glass panels of the bookshelves 
rattled, and the plaster bust fell to the floor, breaking off Richie Blackmore’s 
head. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">“What are you doing?” my mother cried. 
“I paid for that out of my pocket!”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">“Children pee their pants, but I’ll 
train this boy yet.&nbsp; Kill Makhno!”&nbsp; He smashed my tape and went for my guitars.
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">I puffed out my chest and rolled up my 
sleeves, ready to stand like the Maginot Line.&nbsp; But father was as unstoppable as 
a German Tiger. “You think you can stop a Russian officer?&nbsp; You think you can 
raise your fists at me?&nbsp; Yeah, yeah, yeah, I’ll show you, you little wimp!” &nbsp;And 
father tackled me under all his weight. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">“You’re crushing me!” I gasped under the 
weight of father’s body.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">“We’ll see about that,” he said, 
dropping me into the armchair.&nbsp; You could hear the guitar crackling.&nbsp; It sounded 
like the whole world was crunching up, the universe coming apart.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">“I’ll never forgive you,” I swore at him 
through my tears, sweeping the smashed fragments under my bed.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">“Just calm down,” my father’s victorious 
voice rang out.&nbsp; “You’re going to thank me one day.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">“Let your boss thank you, I’m getting 
out of here for good.&nbsp; Get used to not having me around.” Slamming the door 
behind me, I made my grand exit.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">For an entire week I made myself 
scarce.&nbsp; I spent my days on the bank of a forest lake right next to our 
neighborhood, a place that smelled of fresh leaves and muddy water.&nbsp; I slept in 
the attic of an abandoned house, grunge crunching under my feet, the air rife 
with bird dung.&nbsp; I went hungry, started losing weight until I was looking all 
skin and bones.&nbsp; The smell of fire, mud and pigeon shit stuck to me.&nbsp; On the 
eighth day I saw missing child posters with my face on them.&nbsp; On the ninth day, 
like poor little Fedor found by his father in the mountains, I was spotted, 
taken from the roof and brought home.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">“You look <i>terrible</i>!” my mother 
cried when she laid her eyes on me.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Something prompted me to come out with “<i>Je 
ne me suis pas vu depuis sept jours</i>.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">“That’s right, for you it was a lark, 
for me I couldn’t sleep a wink.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In fact, the week had gone by somewhat 
differently.&nbsp; It had given rise to exchanges like this:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Father:&nbsp; How can you get any sleep when 
you don’t even know where the hell your son is?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mother: No use climbing the walls about 
it.&nbsp; He’ll come around and return.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Father: What do you mean come around?&nbsp; 
Come around where?&nbsp;&nbsp; He’s your son!”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mother: Great, just great. Am I the one 
who smashed his guitar? Am the I one who stomped on his cassette?<br>
Father:&nbsp; So what?&nbsp; I broke it, I’ll fix it.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mother:&nbsp; He’ll fix it! Don’t start 
saying no matter what.&nbsp; When it comes to repair jobs you’re all thumbs. </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Father: That’s an insult!&nbsp; I’ve good 
great manual skills.&nbsp; After all, I am a qualified locksmith.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mother:&nbsp; You, a locksmith. You!&nbsp; Apart 
from making big speeches and locking people up, all you know how to do is lying 
in ambush for bitches.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Father:&nbsp; You are reminding me of xer dey 
nait.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mother:&nbsp; Shame on you, wash your mouth 
with soap.&nbsp; You, a member of the Communist Party!</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">But let us return to the day of my 
homecoming.&nbsp; Mother told me that my father hadn’t been able to sit still the 
whole time I was gone.&nbsp; Where, I asked: in ambush?&nbsp; She said I was a smart-ass.&nbsp; 
She said father was sorry.&nbsp; He had fixed my guitar.&nbsp; Indeed, the apartment 
reeked of wood glue, of pine needle rosin, a sharp reminder of the factory with 
its yard littered with bones.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">“Son, what I did was wrong,” father told 
me that evening.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">“Well, what do you expect me to do with 
it?” I asked, pointing to the pieces of my guitar.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">“Don’t worry, I’m going to put it all 
together like new,” he said with brash self-confidence.&nbsp;&nbsp; “I pledge the word of 
a Communist. I’ve already got the glue and the rosin on the boil.&nbsp; Come on, we 
don’t have our hand up our asses! They’re screwed on properly, let’s get to 
work.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The house was frantic with work. The 
moment he got back from work he had a bite to eat and got right down to it. 
“Let’s get this guitar moving.” </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">For a good month we went on sawing, 
planning, digging and soldering.&nbsp; We stank like devils in hell.&nbsp; All we said to 
each other was chisel, rasp, pin, nut, bore, bridge.&nbsp; We hired Leo Smitchkov, 
the maestro of violin makers, as our consultant.&nbsp; My father went as far as to 
break the law in the line of duty, breaking into the safe at work where they 
kept material evidence.&nbsp; He took out the plans of a fingerboard of an Orpheus 
guitar, a Bulgarian make.&nbsp; It enabled us to put together something with a soft, 
smooth sound not particularly appropriate to rock music, but when I added fuzz 
and hooked the guitar up to a reverb, it didn’t sound so bad.&nbsp; All that was 
missing was the varnish.&nbsp; The leftovers went into&nbsp; the kitchen stool.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">“Stool of peace,” my father said 
solemnly – unless he meant piece of stool.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Anyone entering upon the slippery path 
of Russian rock, as indeed of all things Russian, risks breaking one’s head 
open.&nbsp; But that is perhaps our Russian way, slippery, perilous.&nbsp; Perhaps it was 
along this trail that my father found his calling as a parent.&nbsp; Hard to say, for 
my father went on to commit further crimes, going into the vault to bring out 
pieces of evidence from </span><span lang="RU">ÎÁÕÑÑ </span><span lang="EN-US">
cases all the recording of Dieperpoltsev – Deep Purple, that is -- along with 
Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath.&nbsp; Soon my musical archives were complete once 
again.&nbsp; Soon we were making amplifiers and speakers, aided and abetted by 
further crimes on my father’s part.&nbsp; So it was he brought up from the department 
cellar lamps, transistors, a 50-watt speaker.&nbsp; My father alleged he was cleaning 
the stores out.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">It took about a year for my father to be 
able to tell the Beatles apart from the Rolling Stones, and Richie Blackmore 
from a D. Page.&nbsp; Two years later he accompanied me as my sidekick disk jockey, 
and before three years had passed he showed up at a Party meeting in jeans and, 
declaring rock the future of the planet, he demanded deep-seated reforms to the 
socialist laws of the land.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">After making his declaration, my father 
was transferred out of the security department.&nbsp; Hired on as a security manager 
at a sausage factory, he developed a habit of exposing worst-case scenarios of&nbsp; 
rotten meat and was forced into early retirement.&nbsp; The last two years of his 
life he didn’t work but sat watching over my disk jockey equipment.&nbsp; Sitting on 
the stool of peace, he looked out the window anxiously awaiting my return.&nbsp; When 
he saw our car approaching, he came to life.&nbsp; He started putting things 
together.&nbsp; He fermented cabbage, pickled cucumbers, cut into strips Chinese ham, 
and took out the crystal rum glasses he’d received as part of his pension fund 
as a department of the ministy of the interior solderer.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">“Don’t get it my way,” he would say to 
his protesting wife.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">“But you mustn’t!&nbsp; You’ve had two heart 
attacks already!”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">“Step back,” he said.&nbsp; “You’re reminding 
me of Xer Dey Nait.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">“You’re the dick, even if you’re not an 
officer of the Community Party anymore.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">At one of my gigs someone stole our 
guitar.&nbsp; I was no longer using it by now, having acquiring a much better 
Japanese model.&nbsp; But one day when it wouldn’t play, I had had to resort to our 
home-made guitar. In the evening while we were loading the equipment into the 
car I couldn’t find it anywhere.&nbsp; I exhorted food handlers, promising them 
anything in exchange for a clue to its whereabouts, but it was useless: the 
drunk bastards shrugged, looking at me with blank guilty smiles.&nbsp; I alerted all 
the local musicians, but to no avail.&nbsp; It had disappeared without a trace.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Soon thereafter my father died.&nbsp; He 
walked into the kitchen and collapsed; he came out propped on my shoulders, 
already dead.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Outside the courtyard the shrill winds 
of economic reforms were blowing.&nbsp; Not only were the grocery stores all empty 
but the funeral parlors likewise.&nbsp; In the canary yellow building, where the wake 
was held, there was nothing, no brushes, no wreaths, no tapes and no coffins.&nbsp; 
Just the director and a few not quite sober souls.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">“We should call the authorities,” I 
advised my mother. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">“What are you on about?” she asked.&nbsp; 
“Have you forgotten they fired him.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">“Yeah, but with his veterans’ pension,” 
I argued stiffly.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">“Yeah, sure.&nbsp; First they get fired then 
they get medals.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">But it turned out I was right. The 
authorities did pay for the coffin – the boards, the red sheathing and even the 
bright crimson brush. Once more I was hearing them say <i>chisel, saw, rasp, pin</i>…</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">All that remains of my father are some 
of his black and white photographs and that heavily varnished kitchen stool.&nbsp; 
Will we whose lives were so cleverly woven together along the paths of life meet 
once again?&nbsp; Whenever I look at our little peace stool I’m quite certain we 
will.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
